> For context, Collatz's Tape is introduced in a [post prior](https://gbragafibra.github.io/2025/10/15/collatz_ant10.html) for instance. In this one, a small modification is made on top of it.

The following is a comparison between the tape development generated by $n = 371581$ (left - using Collatz's Tape; to be described in a bit) and $\mathbf{BB(4)}$ (right - using the Turing Machine: `1RB1LB_1LA0LC_1RH1LD_1RD0RA`):

The tape on the left is generated in the following manner:

- You consider an empty tape with all unmarked cells, such that the reading head (standing initially in the middle of the tape) applies the collatz function to a starting $n$:

$$
f(n) = \begin{cases}
n/2 & \text{if} \quad n \equiv 0 \quad (\text{mod}\, 2) \\
(3n + 1)/2 & \text{if} \quad n \equiv 1 \quad (\text{mod}\, 2) \\
\end{cases}
$$

flipping the state of the cell it currently stands at (at position $x$) in the following manner:

$$
S(x) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if} \quad n \equiv 0 \quad (\text{mod}\, 3) \\
1 - S(x) & \text{if} \quad n \equiv 1 \quad (\text{mod}\, 3) \\
1 & \text{if} \quad n \equiv 2 \quad (\text{mod}\, 3) \\
\end{cases}
$$

Additionally, the reading head moves left if $n$ is odd, and right if $n$ is even. It will do this until $n = 1$ is reached. The tape development can then be seen over time (â†“). E.g. $n = 10^{20}$:

Albeit, there are vast differences between the examples shown initially, this comparison was made because it's known that many [Busy Beaver champions (and candidates) display Collatz-like behaviour](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3749). 

- However, do (should) Busy Beavers themselves simulate any Collatz number(s) (using the version of Collatz's Tape displayed before)?
